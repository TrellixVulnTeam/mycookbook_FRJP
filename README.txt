Overview:
This site allows users to view recipes submitted, browse by meal, search by
recipe name or ingredients included, and submit new recipes to the database. This
is something I have wanted to create for a few months now because I have wanted
a consolidated place with recipes I use that allow the functionality I have included.
This will help me plan and find recipes that I have used without digging through
a number of cookbooks, websites, and other recipe locations. I used a combination
of flexboxes and bootstrap to make the design for the website. I also use two modals
in the "Submit a Recipe" section.
